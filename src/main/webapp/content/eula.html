    <h1>BILLING POLICY</h1>
    <h4>General Billing</h4>
    <div>Usage of Infusionsoft products and services constitutes customer's acceptance of Infusionsoft's billing policy, and all customers must comply with this billing policy.</div>
    <div><strong>Special note regarding signed contracts: If you entered into a signed contract for your services, such as an annual contract, please review your contract for specific terms relating to your obligations in addition this billing policy. In the event the terms of your signed contract conflict with these terms, the signed contract will prevail.</strong></div>
    <ul>
        <li>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all accounts are set up on a prepaid basis, and payment must be received by Infusionsoft before any billable product or service is provided/activated. Customers are required to keep a valid credit/debit card on file to charge for recurring monthly subscription fees, fax or voice broadcast service fees and all email overage fees.</li>
        <li>Subscription billing is based on availability of products and services, not based on usage. However, certain fees may be usage-based such as fax, voice broadcast service fees, and email overages. Disabled applications will incur monthly subscription fees, regardless of availability of product in the case of a breach of online terms including but not limited to delinquent accounts.</li>
        <li>Customers are responsible for keeping all credit/debit card details and contact information current. This can be done online through the Customer Center. To access the Customer Center, customers should log into their Infusionsoft application, click on "My account" and then click <a href="http://help.infusionsoft.com/userguides/get-started/initial-setup-checklist/update-your-billing-information" target="_blank">"Update your billing info"</a>.</li>
        <li>All recurring subscriptions are automatically invoiced and charged to the credit/debit card on file.</li>
        <li>Payment receipts are available to customers upon request or through the Customer Center.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Billing Cycle</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Credit/Debit Card Billing: All credit/debit cards are automatically charged on the customer's specific billing cycle date.</li>
        <li>Late Fee: All past due accounts may be assessed a late fee.</li>
        <li>Delinquent Payments: In the event any payment is 15 days past due the account may be disabled until balances are paid in full. When disabled, all access will be suspended and data will be unavailable.</li>
        <li>Deactivation: Once an account is delinquent 60 days, it may be cancelled due to non-payment. Once cancelled, the customer will not be able to recover any files until the account is current. Application data may be stored for up to 90 days post-cancellation; after 90 days, application data will no longer be available. In this event, the account record and delinquent balance will be submitted to a third-party collection service.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Fees</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Late Fee: Infusionsoft may assess a $30.00 late fee for any payment that is 15 days past due.</li>
        <li>Chargebacks: If a customer initiates a chargeback, Infusionsoft may assess a $50.00 processing fee for each individual chargeback.</li>
        <li>Returned Checks: Infusionsoft may assess a $50.00 processing fee on each returned check.</li>
        <li>Collections Fee: In the event an account is submitted to a third-party collections service, a $35.00 processing fee may be assessed to the existing account balance. This fee is in addition to any other fees previously assessed on the account.</li>
        <li>Interest: Any charges not paid when due are subject to interest at a rate equal to the lesser of: (i)&nbsp;one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (ii)&nbsp;the maximum interest rate allowed by applicable law.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Infusionsoft Services</h4>
    <div>Kickstart Services and all other Services purchased from Infusionsoft must be used within the timeframe specified at the time of purchase. Specifically, Kickstart Services must be used within 60 days after purchase and within 30 days after commencement of use of the Services, unless otherwise stated at purchase. Kickstart Services and all other Service fees are nonrefundable. In the event of cancellation, Infusionsoft will not prorate any portion of unused Service fees, and amounts due to Infusionsoft must be paid in full.</div>
    <h4>Third Party Products and Advertising Usage</h4>
    <div>In the event Infusionsoft collects fees for any third party products and/or services, including but not limited to advertising usage, the fees are non-refundable.</div>
    <h4>Payment Methods</h4>
    <div>Infusionsoft accepts payments via credit/debit card. Infusionsoft currently accepts American Express, MasterCard, Discover and VISA credit/debit cards.</div>
    <h4>Subscription Billing</h4>
    <div>Invoices are generated and payments are collected at the beginning of each billing period. Customer billing periods typically begin on the day of the month in which the customer purchased the Infusionsoft subscription. Customers must request to cancel their subscriptions at least 10&nbsp;days prior to their next billing date in order to avoid being charged on the billing date. In the event of cancellation, customers will still have access to their applications through the end of their final billing period. Infusionsoft will not prorate any portion of unused subscription services. All subscription fees are nonrefundable.</div>
    <h4>Cancellation Process</h4>
    <div><u>Creating a Cancellation request</u>: A request to cancel an Infusionsoft application must be initiated at least 10&nbsp;days prior to the next invoice date. Any request to cancel an Infusionsoft application must be made verbally with an Infusionsoft representative at least 10&nbsp;days prior to the next invoice date. Emailed requests to cancel are not acceptable. Customers are encouraged to keep records of all communications regarding cancellation.</div>
    <div>Simply canceling the credit/debit card associated with an Infusionsoft account does not cancel the account. Infusionsoft will continue to treat this as an open account and the billing cycle will continue, resulting in a past due account that may be turned over to a third party collection service. It is imperative that you speak with an Infusionsoft representative or submit an online ticket through the cancellation form if you wish to initiate cancelation of your Infusionsoft account.</div>
    <div><u>Finalizing the Cancellation</u>: After a request to cancel has been initiated, you must speak with a member of the cancellation team to finalize the cancellation. Cancellations will take effect on the last day of the billing period in which the cancellation was processed by the cancellation team, subject to the terms of the "Subscription Billing" paragraph above.</div>
    <div>Cancellation of an account does not dismiss outstanding invoices or nullify previously agreed charges, such as payments for Kickstart Services fees, charged in installments or annual contract charges, portions of which may not yet have been invoiced when you cancelled. At the time of cancellation, any outstanding balance must be settled. All cancelled accounts with an outstanding balance may be turned over to a third-party collection service.</div>
    <h4>Billing Disputes</h4>
    <div>Each Infusionsoft customer agrees to provide Infusionsoft 30 days to attempt settlement of any billing dispute before disputing with any third-party credit/debit card company or bank. Should Infusionsoft receive a chargeback from a third-party credit/debit card company or bank on the customer's behalf before Infusionsoft has been given a chance to resolve the issue, Infusionsoft has the right to charge the customer for its time spent in resolving such disputes and any associated fees incurred by Infusionsoft, in addition to the $50 chargeback fee mentioned above. Regardless of the outcome of the chargeback, Infusionsoft retains the right to collect on any Services or fees that are due. Infusionsoft may submit any disputed amounts to a collection agency. Once a chargeback has been received, Infusionsoft has the right to suspend the account until the matter is resolved.</div>
    <h4>Refunds</h4>
    <div>Subscription and Service fees, including but not limited to those related to the Kickstart Service, are nonrefundable and will not be prorated at any time.</div>

    <h1>DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY AT INFUSIONSOFT</h1>
    <div>At Infusionsoft, we see data protection and privacy as a fundamental part of who we are. To help our customers succeed, data protection is built into our software and our culture from the ground up.</div>
    <div>Thousands of small businesses depend on us to keep their data secure and to enable their compliance with a variety of data protection laws around the world. Our comprehensive data protection program is designed to help you meet the challenges of a tough, complex regulatory environment.</div>
    <div>Scroll down to read more about our comprehensive data protection program.</div>
    <h4>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework</h4>
    <div>Infusionsoft recognizes that our customers located in the European Economic Area operate under strict local privacy laws. These laws prevent EEA businesses from making available any data that can be used to identify a specific, individual person (also known as "PII" or "personal data") to companies that are not subject to such strict privacy laws. However, U.S. businesses such as Infusionsoft have the option to participate in a U.S. government-sponsored program that entitles us to an exception from this export ban, so that European customers can lawfully use Infusionsoft; but in exchange for this privilege, Infusionsoft must protect the PII to the same standard that’s required by European law.</div>
    <div>This voluntary-to-join program was formerly known as the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Program. In October&nbsp;2015, a European court decided that the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Program wasn’t robust enough to protect PII transferred to the United States.</div>
    <div>Infusionsoft expects that in 2016, a replacement transatlantic data protection framework will be ready for use. The new framework will be known as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. As soon as the new Privacy Shield Framework is available, Infusionsoft will work diligently to comply with and certify our adherence to the new framework, providing further legal certainty for our European customers.</div>
    <div>In the meantime, EEA businesses can continue to lawfully use Infusionsoft by executing our Data Processing Addendum. The Addendum includes the EU Model Contract Clauses (for more details, refer to the section "European Privacy Laws" below).</div>
    <h4>U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework</h4>
    <div>Infusionsoft remains a member of the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Programs, although their legal recognition in various non-U.S. countries is in doubt.</div>
    <div>Our EEA/CH Safe Harbor Notice describes our continued commitment to comply with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks.</div>

    <h4>European Privacy Laws</h4>

    <h1>EEA/CH SAFE HARBOR NOTICE</h1>
    <h4>Effective on: January&nbsp;19, 2015</h4>
    <h4>General</h4>
    <div>Infusion Software, Inc. ("Infusionsoft" or "we") recognize(s) that the European Community has established a data protection regime pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC (the "Directive"). The Directive applies to the European Economic Area ("EEA"). The Swiss Confederation ("Switzerland") has also established a data protection regime pursuant to the Federal Act on Data Protection ("FADP"). These regimes restrict companies in the EEA and Switzerland (collectively, "EEA/CH") from transferring personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH to the United States, unless there is "adequate protection" for such personal data when it is received in the United States. To create such "adequate protection" and to overcome the restriction on international data transfers established by the Directive and the FADP, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by US Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor Principles") with respect to certain personal data about individuals in the EEA/CH that we receive from our subsidiaries, customers, and other business partners. For more information on the Safe Harbor Principles, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</div>
    <h4>Scope of this Notice</h4>
    <div>This Notice addresses data subjects in the EEA/CH ("EEA/CH Persons") whose data we may receive from one of our subsidiaries, customers, suppliers, or other business partners. This Notice does not apply to employees of Infusionsoft, or the data that we receive directly through Infusionsoft's publicly accessible websites. In addition, our customers use our hosted technology platform to store and process data of their own customers at their own discretion. In this instance, we act only as a storage and service provider, without any interest or knowledge about what is being stored, and shall only access such data at our customer's request in connection with customer support or account administration matters, or as may be required by law.</div>
    <h4>Categories of EEA/CH Data</h4>
    <div>Infusionsoft sells sales and marketing software-related services primarily to small businesses. Our customers use our hosted technology platforms to store and process EEA/CH Data at their own discretion. Since EEA/CH Data covered by this Notice is by definition sent to us by another company, the categories of data sent and the purposes of processing often depend on such other company, with whom the EEA/CH Persons typically have a closer employment or business relationship (and which, therefore, can provide additional information on categories of data shared with us).</div>
    <h4>Purposes</h4>
    <div>We collect and use EEA/CH Data for the purposes of providing products and services to our customers, communicating with corporate business partners about business matters, processing EEA/CH Data on behalf of corporate customers, providing information on our services, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes.</div>
    <h4>Disclosure</h4>
    <div>We share EEA/CH Data with our subsidiaries, agents, and contractors, who process EEA/CH Data on behalf of Infusionsoft. We also share EEA/CH Data with other third parties for the purposes for which we receive the EEA/CH Data (e.g., performance of contractual obligations and rights), and we may also disclose EEA/CH Data where we are legally required to disclose (e.g., under statutes, contracts or otherwise) or the disclosure is permitted by law or the Safe Harbor Principles, and we have a legitimate business interest in such disclosure.</div>
    <div>With respect to marketing emails, EEA/CH Persons may opt out of receiving further email marketing communications from Infusionsoft by submitting the opt-out request form located at <a href="http://pages.infusionsoft.com/Manage-Subscriptions.html">http://pages.infusionsoft.com/Manage-Subscriptions.html</a> or by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link found in the footer of our email messages. EEA/CH Persons may also send an email to <a href="mailto:dataoptout@infusionsoft.com">dataoptout@infusionsoft.com</a> to opt out of disclosures to third parties, but such a limitation on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible for us to provide the requested services.</div>
    <h4>Data Integrity &amp; Security</h4>
    <div>Infusionsoft employs technical, administrative, and physical measures that are reasonably designed to help protect personal information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</div>
    <h4>Access &amp; Review</h4>
    <div>If you are an EEA/CH Person about whom we hold EEA/CH Data, you may request access to, and the opportunity to update, correct, or delete, such EEA/CH Data. To submit such requests or raise any other questions, please contact the business that provided your EEA/CH Data to us. You can also contact us at <a href="mailto:dataoptout@infusionsoft.com">dataoptout@infusionsoft.com</a>. We reserve the right to take appropriate steps to authenticate an applicant's identity, to charge a reasonable fee before providing access and to deny requests, except as required by the Safe Harbor Principles.</div>
    <h4>Safe Harbor Contact &amp; Dispute Resolution Process</h4>
    <div>If you have questions, please contact us at:<br>Infusion Software, Inc.<br>Attn: Legal Department<br>1260 South Spectrum Boulevard<br>Chandler, Arizona 85286<br>USA</div>
    <div>Or you may call us at <a href="tel:18668000004">+1&nbsp;866&nbsp;800&nbsp;0004</a>. We will promptly investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes in a manner that complies with the principles described in this Notice. If you are not satisfied with our response, or if contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you can contact VeraSafe&trade; here: <a href="https://www.verasafe.com/dispute-submission" target="_blank">https://www.verasafe.com/dispute-submission</a>.

    <div>When you purchase "Advertising Services" (as defined below) from Infusionsoft, this Addendum applies to all Advertising Services that Infusionsoft may provide to you in connection with the Infusionsoft Services you use, and this Addendum serves to modify and is made a part of Infusionsoft’s "Terms of Use" (found online at <a href="https://www.infusionsoft.com/legal/terms-of-use">www.infusionsoft.com/legal/terms-of-use</a>) that already apply to your use of the Infusionsoft Services. In the event that this Addendum conflicts with the Terms of Use, for purposes of the Advertising Services only, this Addendum will prevail.</div>
    <div>Please read this Addendum carefully before completing your purchase. By clicking the "I accept" button or otherwise accepting this Addendum as set forth in any order form (including electronic or email order forms) referencing this Addendum, you and any company you represent agree to follow and be bound by the terms and conditions of this Addendum and the Terms of Use.

If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree to all terms and conditions of this Addendum and the Terms of Use, you must choose the "cancel" button and you shall not be permitted to use the Infusionsoft Advertising Services.</div>
    <div>Because you’ll be using the Advertising Services to use yourself or as an agent for the actual advertising person or entity, we’ll refer to you as the "Advertiser" in this Addendum, regardless of which situation applies. You agree that your acceptance of this Addendum will legally bind any such advertisers, that you are legally authorized to bind them in this manner, and that you and the advertiser you represent are jointly and separately (severally) bound by your acceptance of this Addendum as if you each separately consented to it.</div>

Advertising Services offered by Infusionsoft will change from time to time and may be discontinued by Infusionsoft at any time.</div>
    <div>1.2 This Addendum applies only to the specific Advertising Services you request and pay for and Infusionsoft provides.</div>
    <div>1.3 Advertiser understands that clicks to Advertiser’s site, including clicks on search engines, shopping engines, content sites, and the like, may include singular/plural combinations, misspellings, and other related but not exactly Advertiser-matched search terms that Infusionsoft uses to map to Advertiser’s campaigns.</div>
    <div>1.4 Advertiser is solely responsible for the quality and accuracy of its own and its clients’ (if applicable) websites, landing pages and redirect websites that link to ads.</div>

You, not Infusionsoft, shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, integrity, and reliability of Your Data, and Infusionsoft will not be responsible or liable for the deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any of Your Data. Infusionsoft will protect any of Your Data provided to Infusionsoft as confidential in accordance with Article IV below.</div>
    <div><strong>2.6 Protection of PHI.</strong> You agree to alert Infusionsoft in writing if you will be using the Services to store or process PHI. To the extent that You do use the Services to store or process PHI, then the terms of the <a href="https://www.infusionsoft.com/legal/business-associate-agreement">Infusionsoft Business Associate Agreement</a> will apply to any PHI stored or processed by You using the Services and the terms of the Infusionsoft Business Associate Agreement are incorporated herein by reference. Upon either Your or Infusionsoft's request, both parties will execute a signable version of the Infusionsoft Business Associate Agreement.</div>
    <h2>Article III. Fees</h2>
    <div><strong>3.1 Fees.</strong> The fees for the Infusionsoft Service and any additional Services ("Fees") are set forth in the Order Form and are payable in advance, irrevocable and non-refundable except as set forth in the Order Form and this Agreement. You agree to provide Infusionsoft with complete and accurate billing and contact information. Where payment by credit card is indicated in the Order Form, or You otherwise provide Infusionsoft with credit card information, You authorize Infusionsoft to bill such credit card (a) at the time that You order the Infusionsoft Service or other Services set forth in the Order Form, (b) for any billing frequency otherwise established in the Order Form, and (c) at the time of any renewal, for the amount charged plus any applicable sales taxes for any renewed Subscription Term. If Infusionsoft, in its discretion, permits You to make payment using a method other than a credit card, Infusionsoft will invoice You at the time of the initial Order Form and thereafter on a monthly basis in advance of the relevant billing period, and all such amounts invoiced will be due within ten (10) days of Your receipt of Infusionsoft's invoice. Late payments shall be subject to a service charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum charge permitted by law, whichever is less.</div>
    <div><strong>3.2 Taxes.</strong> You shall pay all personal property, sales, use, value-added, withholding and similar taxes (other than taxes on Infusionsoft's net income) arising from the transactions described in this Agreement, even if such amounts are not listed on an Order Form. To the extent You are exempt from sales or other taxes, You agree to provide Infusionsoft, upon request, with the appropriate exemption certificate.</div>
    <div><strong>3.3 Non-Payment; Other Suspension Rights.</strong> Infusionsoft may terminate the Infusionsoft Service if the billing or contact information provided by You is false or fraudulent. Infusionsoft also reserves the right, in its discretion, to suspend Your access and/or use of the Infusionsoft Service: (i) where any payment is due but unpaid and You have been requested but failed to promptly cure such payment failure; or (ii) in the event a dispute arises on Your account as to who at Your business has authority to act or manage Your account and Infusionsoft is not promptly provided with written instructions from the interested parties associated with Your account that fully resolves the dispute. You acknowledge and agree that it a dispute arises as to management of Your account, then (i) if the listed owner of the account is a corporation, limited liability company or other registered entity, Infusionsoft may rely on public records (to the extent available) concerning the appropriate authorized executives or managers of Your entity; or (ii) if the listed owner is a dba or sole proprietorship, or any other entity for which public records of control are not readily accessible online, Infusionsoft may assume that the person or entity that has been making payments on Your account has the authority to manage the account. You agree that Infusionsoft shall not be liable to You nor to any third party for any suspension of the Infusionsoft Service resulting from Your non-payment of Fees or from a dispute as to the management rights to Your account.</div>
    <h2>Article IV. Confidentiality; Use of Names</h2>
    <div><strong>4.1 Confidential Information.</strong> For purposes of this Agreement, confidential information shall include the business terms in the Order Form, Your Data, the Infusionsoft Service and the Infusionsoft Materials, and any information that is clearly identified in writing at the time of disclosure as confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be confidential by the receiving party given the nature of the information and the circumstances of its disclosure ("Confidential Information"). Each party agrees: (a) to receive and maintain in confidence all Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party or by a third-party; (b) not to use the Confidential Information of the other party except to the extent necessary to perform its obligations or exercise rights hereunder; (c) to limit the internal dissemination of Confidential Information to those employees and contractors of the recipient who have a need to know and an obligation to protect it; and (d) to protect the confidentiality thereof in the same manner as it protects the confidentiality of similar information and data of its own (at all times exercising at least a reasonable degree of care in the protection of such Confidential Information). Infusionsoft will restrict its employees' access to Your Confidential Information to only those employees necessary to successfully provide the Infusionsoft Service. Infusionsoft may disclose Confidential Information on a need-to-know basis to its contractors who have executed written agreements requiring them to maintain such information in strict confidence and use it only to facilitate the performance of their services for Infusionsoft in connection with the performance of this Agreement. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (1) is known publicly; (2) is generally known in the industry before disclosure; (3) has become known publicly, without fault of the recipient, subsequent to disclosure by the disclosing party; or (4) the recipient becomes aware of from a third party not bound by non-disclosure obligations to the disclosing party and with the lawful right to disclose such information to the recipient. This Section will not be construed to prohibit the disclosure of Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or order of a court or other governmental authority. The parties agree to give the other party prompt notice of the receipt of any subpoena or other similar request for such disclosure.</div>
    <div><strong>4.2 Credit Card Information.</strong> Infusionsoft agrees that it will retain and store any provided credit card information only for the minimum amount of time required for business, legal and/or regulatory purposes, and will use standard industry practices to protect such information from unauthorized access, disclosure or use.</div>
    <div><strong>4.3 Use of Names in Marketing.</strong> You may use Infusionsoft's name and credentials in an appropriate and acceptable manner for Your standard marketing promotions, provided that You agree to cease or alter such use at Infusionsoft's request where such use is contrary to Infusionsoft's branding policies, could cause any brand confusion in the market or is otherwise objectionable to Infusionsoft. Similarly, Infusionsoft may use Your business name in an appropriate and acceptable manner for standard marketing promotions, provided that Infusionsoft agrees to cease or alter such use at Your request where such use is contrary to Your branding policies, could cause any brand confusion in the market or is otherwise objectionable to You. Acceptable and standard marketing promotions include, but are not limited to: client listings, press releases, surveys, interviews, reputable business publications, television, and web site presentation and promotion, etc.</div>
    <h2>Article V. Term &amp; Termination</h2>

In addition, for a period of thirty (30) days following termination, You may arrange for the downloading of Your Data by contacting Infusionsoft. Following this (30) day grace period, Infusionsoft may remove Your Data from the production environment for the Infusionsoft Service. The provisions of this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination shall survive, including but not limited to obligations concerning confidentiality, protection of intellectual property, indemnification and payment of unpaid Fees and expenses.</div>
    <h2>Article VI. Warranties/limitation of Liability/indemnity</h2>
    <div><strong>6.1 Limited Warranties.</strong> Infusionsoft warrants for a period of thirty (30) days following their delivery that all professional Services provided hereunder will be performed in a workmanlike manner, in conformity with the professional standards for comparable services in the industry.

To the extent that You either purchase the Infusionsoft Service from such third parties or acquire the Third Party Content or configuration services from such third parties (even though you may purchase the core Infusionsoft Service directly from Infusionsoft), Infusionsoft does not warrant in any manner and will not be responsible for such Third Party Content and You agree to look solely to the relevant third party provider (and not Infusionsoft) if and to the extent that you have any complaints or issues relating to the Third Party Content or its interaction with an Infusionsoft Service.</div>

    <h1>TRADEMARK USAGE GUIDELINES</h1>
    <div>Infusion Software, Inc. d/b/a Infusionsoft ("Infusionsoft") considers its trademarks and the goodwill represented by such trademarks as extremely valuable assets. It is therefore important that you follow these guidelines when using any of the Infusionsoft Trademarks. Infusionsoft will take all appropriate legal and equity steps necessary or advisable to preserve the strength and retain the exclusive rights to use its trademarks. For the purposes of these guidelines, the "Infusionsoft Trademarks" include all registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks (such as words, names, symbols, devices, slogans or any combination thereof) owned by Infusionsoft, including without limitation, those trademarks and service marks listed on <a href="https://www.infusionsoft.com/legal/trademark-list">Infusionsoft Trademark List</a>.</div>
    <div>If you have any questions about these guidelines, please direct them to <a class="email_address" href="mailto:trademarks@infusionsoft.com">trademarks@infusionsoft.com</a>.</div>
    <h4>General Guidelines</h4>
    <div>Infusionsoft is the exclusive owner of the Infusionsoft Trademarks and reserves all rights not expressly granted herein or pursuant to a separate license agreement. Accordingly, any goodwill derived from using an Infusionsoft Trademark inures solely to Infusionsoft's benefit. By using an Infusionsoft Trademark, in whole or in part, you are acknowledging that Infusionsoft is the sole owner of the trademark and promising that you will not interfere with Infusionsoft's rights in the trademark, including challenging Infusionsoft's use, registration of, or application to register such trademark, alone or in combination with other words, anywhere in the world, and that you will not harm, misuse, or bring into disrepute any Infusionsoft trademark.</div>
    <div>To the extent that Infusionsoft has entered into a business relationship with you, Infusionsoft may have provided with you specific requirements for how the Infusionsoft Trademarks are to be used in terms of size, typeface, colors, other graphic characteristics of the trademarks, or other limitations and you must abide by those requirements when using the Infusionsoft Trademarks.</div>
    <h4>Permitted Use of Infusionsoft Trademarks</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>You may use the Infusionsoft Trademarks to accurately describe how your products or services relate to Infusionsoft's products and services, so long as you observe these guidelines and it is clear that your products and services are not offered, sponsored, associated with or endorsed by Infusionsoft. <em>See Compatibility below.</em></li>
        <li>You may use taglines that refer to Infusionsoft's Trademarks; provided that such taglines always appear in smaller and less prominent type than your company's own brand name and use a different typeface, colors or other graphic characteristics.</li>
        <li>You must make the Infusionsoft Trademarks distinguishable from the surrounding text in some manner, such as capitalizing the trademark, enclosing it in quotes, and/or using a different typeface or font for the trademark.</li>
        <li>You may use the Infusionsoft Trademarks only in the form provided by Infusionsoft and may not use them in plural or modified forms.</li>
        <li>You must always use the appropriate trademark symbol, such as &trade;, &#8480; or &reg;, as specified by Infusionsoft and include written text in a footnote to indicate the trademark is owned by Infusionsoft and used by you with permission. Use the following format:
            <div style="font-style: italic;">"Infusionsoft" and the "Infusionsoft logo" are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Infusion Software, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries.</div>
        </li>
        <li>You must always use an Infusionsoft Trademark as an adjective followed by the generic category name of the product or service it modifies, such as Infusionsoft&reg; CRM or Infusionsoft&reg; software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Infusionsoft" functions not only as a trademark and service mark identifying its goods and services, but also as a trade name or company name referring to Infusion Software, Inc. Trade names are nouns and, therefore, should not be followed by a generic descriptor and may be used in the possessive form. When used as a trade name, "Infusionsoft" should not be followed by a trademark symbol. Within documents, the first reference to the trade or company name should be "Infusion Software, Inc." Thereafter, "Infusionsoft" can be used for subsequent references</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Prohibited Use of Infusionsoft Trademarks</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>You may not incorporate an Infusionsoft Trademark into your company's name, publication title, conference title, website name, product or service name or domain name without Infusionsoft's prior written consent which may require a license agreement in Infusionsoft's sole discretion.</li>
        <li>You may not use an Infusionsoft Trademark as a noun or verb, only as an adjective describing the generic category name of the product or service of which it represents.</li>
        <li>You may not use misspellings, abbreviations, phonetic equivalents, or trademarks that rhyme with or sound like, or any marks that are confusingly similar to the Infusionsoft Trademarks. You may not use abbreviations or foreign language translations of the Infusionsoft Trademarks.</li>
        <li>You may not use company names, product names, url names or domain names that combine an Infusionsoft Trademark with other words, terms or trademarks so as to create a unitary mark. For example, you should not use www.MYinfusionsoft.com as your domain name or name your product "InfusionsoftLINK."</li>
        <li>You may not use an Infusionsoft logo or design (such as the "swish" symbol) in connection with your products or services except under a license agreement with Infusionsoft.</li>
        <li>You may not incorporate any Infusionsoft logo or design in your own company or product logos.</li>
        <li>You may not display any Infusionsoft logo or design on your website or other promotional materials except under a license agreement with Infusionsoft.</li>
        <li>You may not use Infusionsoft Trademarks in a disparaging, false or misleading way.</li>
        <li>You may not use Infusionsoft Trademarks on or in connection with any defamatory, scandalous, pornographic, or other objectionable materials of any sort.</li>
        <li>You may not use typefaces for your company name, product name or service name that look like those of an Infusionsoft Trademark and create the potential impression of an association, affiliation or sponsorship between Infusionsoft and your company. You may not use logos or designs that incorporate design elements of or look similar to those of Infusionsoft.</li>
        <li>You may not adopt Infusionsoft's distinctive trade dress elements in your company website, packaging, marketing or other materials.</li>
        <li>You may not manufacture, sell or give-away merchandise items, such as T-shirts, key chains, and mugs, bearing any Infusionsoft Trademark, including symbols, logos, or icons, except under a license agreement with Infusionsoft.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Other Similar Terms</h4>
    <div>While Infusionsoft does not own registered trademarks for other similar uses, such as "infuse", "infused" or "infusion", given the similarity to the Infusionsoft Trademarks, use of such similar terms can create confusion in the marketplace regarding the source, original or sponsorship of such products. Therefore, to avoid such confusion, we do not permit the use of such similar terms.</div>
    <h4>Compatibility</h4>
    <div>With the exception of the Infusionsoft logos (the use of which requires a license agreement with Infusionsoft), you generally may use the Infusionsoft Trademarks to refer to Infusionsoft's products or services in advertising, promotional, and sales materials, assuming that you have the necessary authority to sell or promote Infusionsoft's products or services, e.g. authorized reseller, licensee, etc.</div>
    <div>You may indicate the relationship of your products and services to Infusionsoft's products or services by using an accurate referential phrase in connection with your product or service, for example, "for use with Infusionsoft&reg; software" or "compatible with Infusionsoft&reg; software" provided that: (a) the Infusionsoft Trademark appears less prominent than the product or service name; (b) the Infusionsoft Trademark is not a part of or incorporated in your product or service name; and (c) the referential phrase is accurate and complies with the requirements of these guidelines and as set forth in any license agreement with Infusionsoft.</div>
    <h4>Misuse of Infusionsoft Trademarks by Others</h4>
    <div>If you learn of any uses of any trademarks that are confusingly similar to the Infusionsoft Trademarks, please notify Infusionsoft by sending an e-mail to <a class="email_address" href="mailto:trademarks@infusionsoft.com">trademarks@infusionsoft.com</a>. Similarly, if you become aware of any use of an Infusionsoft Trademark that violates any of the rules described above, including failure to identify Infusionsoft Trademarks as belonging to Infusionsoft, please notify us at <a class="email_address" href="mailto:trademarks@infusionsoft.com">trademarks@infusionsoft.com</a>. If possible, please provide a copy of the article or other medium in which the trademark violation appeared.</div>
    <h4>Changes to Trademark Usage Guidelines</h4>
    <div>Infusionsoft may add to, change, update or modify these guidelines or the Infusionsoft Trademarks by posting such addition, change, update or modification on this website. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the website.</div>
